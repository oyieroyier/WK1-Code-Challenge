# WK1-Code-Challenge

This is the first Coding challenge for Moringa School's **sdf-ft-03-hybrid** cohort.

The challenge has three parts:
1. Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
2. Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
3. Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

~~~~
- A = 79
- B = 60 to 79
- C = 59 to 49
- D = 40 to 49
- E = less 40.
~~~~

This is a simple program executed purely using JavaScript conditional statements.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80.
If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

**For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.**

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
Calculate the PAYE (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the links [HERE](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.ht "LINK") and [HERE](https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye)  

This was the toughest and most interesting of the challenges and I implemented it using functions calling other functions to arrive at the answer.
I also understood and appreciated the importance of scoping because every time I needed to make a change in my code, all I had to do was edit the values within a function and not touch any other aspect of the code.
